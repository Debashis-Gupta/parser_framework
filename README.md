### This is a repository for making a parser framework for Darpa Theia Dataset

#### Progress so far
We have made a python file (graph_draw) that draws the first 500 nodes of the graph

***To run shell command*** **:** 
``` python helper/graph_draw.py ```

Here is a sample image of 50 nodes directed graph from darapa theia dataset
